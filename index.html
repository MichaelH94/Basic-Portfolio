            <p>Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Michael Haggard. I'm a 24 year old programmer from Kansas.
                I'm currently attending a full stack web development coding bootcamp through the University of Kansas, and have
                an Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Northern Oklahoma College. I'm looking to begin a career in web development, and 
                I am always striving to further improve my skills. Outside of programming, I spend most of my time with my four wonderful children
                and my beautiful wife. I listen to way too much music, enjoy fine bourbon, write and worldbuild, and, of course, play video games.
            </p>

                On this site, you'll find examples of my programming work as well. As of writing this, my portfolio is quite bare. Despite this,
                I have experience in several programming languages. These include Visual Basic, Java, and C++, as well as web development frontend
                languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also have some experience working with Ruby through basic video game development. While
                I plan on a career in web development, I really enjoy every aspect of coding. In addition to programming experience, I also have experience
                in other aspects of IT. I've worked for a defense contractor (details fall under a NDA, unfortunately) running an advanced WiFi network, and
                have built networks for several organizations and non-profits.

                My current projects are a simple WordPress blog located <a href="http://teamzxcv.com">here</a>, various assignments for my programming class, and a very long-term
                RPG for mobile phones. I plan on expanding my portfolio and refining my skills in order to build a career for myself and my family. Feel free to use the contact
                page if you need to reach me through email.
